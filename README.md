# python
This repo is dedicated to exercises in python using Diablo 2 LOD as a basis for exploration.  Currently these programs function as a low-automation prototype to play the game using only mouse and keyboard commands, based entirely on static on-screen elements.  The goal is ultimately building an automated system of gameplay, text recognition, and database manipulations, to establish rates in which certain item affixes show up for any given crafted item group.

If none of that makes sense, that's quite alright, this project is entirely stupid, while also extremely fruitfull for my learning.
